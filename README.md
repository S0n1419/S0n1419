## Hi, I'm Thái Sơn 👋

I'm a student majoring in Mathematics and Informatics at Ha Noi University of Science and Technology.  
I love solving problems, exploring the intersection between math and technology, and turning ideas into code.


🎓 I'm currently studying Computer Science fundamentals and mathematical logic.  
🔍 I'm especially interested in how math can enhance algorithms, machine learning, and systems design.  
🛠️ I'm working on a project applying numerical methods to solve linear systems of equations, display operations on matrix.  
🌱 On a personal journey to become more open and confident in communication.

😄 Fun fact: I used to be quiet, but now I'm learning to speak up and connect more with people — one step at a time!
